## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## üìú Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.  
This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

It copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them.  
All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

You don't need to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, but it‚Äôs available if you want deeper customization.
